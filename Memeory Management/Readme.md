![Alt text](<./mm.png>)

**There are two types of data :**
1. Primitives
2. References

**Primitives :** primitives are int, boolean, float, string etc. There are stored directly in the stack memory as their binary representation.

**References:** These are more complex data types like objects and arrays which are typically stored in memory as a reference to a location in memory where the actual object data is stored **(Heap Memory).**
